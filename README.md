# Demonstration of blurred HTML content

This is a tiny demo that I threw together based upon [an example I found on the web].  It
certainly looks promising, although I have a few reservations about the need to add markup
in order to achieve it.  Additionally, it can't be controlled from "pure CSS" because the
blur radius needs to be embedded into the SVG markup.
